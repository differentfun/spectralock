# SpectraLock

Hide and recover text (URLs or generic messages) inside an image while protecting it with a password. The script automatically uses [Zenity](https://help.gnome.org/users/zenity/stable/) dialogs when available and falls back to plain terminal prompts otherwise.

## Features
- Authenticated encryption (AES-GCM) with keys derived from the password using scrypt.
- Least-significant-bit (LSB) embedding so only a single bit per pixel channel is modified.
- PNG output uses lossless LSB embedding, while JPEG output stores the payload inside custom metadata blocks.
- Supports arbitrary UTF-8 text within the capacity offered by the image.
- Accepts PNG, JPEG/JPG, and most Pillow-supported formats as sources, keeping the chosen format for the stego image.

## Requirements
- Python â‰¥ 3.8
- Python packages: `cryptography`, `Pillow`
- Optional: `zenity` binary on PATH for the graphical dialogs (often packaged as `zenity` or `gnome-zenity`).

## Quick Start
1. Create a virtual environment (see `set-environment.sh`) and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install cryptography Pillow
   ```
2. Launch the tool:
   ```bash
   python3 spectralock.py
   ```
   or simply run
   ```bash
   bash launch.sh
   ```
   which creates/activates the virtual environment automatically before starting SpectraLock.

### Encrypt and Hide Text
1. Choose **Encrypt and hide text**.
2. Pick the source image (any Pillow-supported format).
3. Enter the message you want to hide.
4. Provide and confirm the encryption password.
5. Choose where to save the output image (saved as PNG; `.png` is added automatically if omitted).

### Recover Hidden Text
1. Choose **Recover hidden text**.
2. Select the image that contains hidden data.
3. Enter the password. If it matches, the original text is displayed.

## Tips and Limitations
- Ensure the image is large enough. Each byte of encrypted data consumes 8 pixel channels, plus 32 header bits.
- Avoid any lossy transformations (JPEG re-save, aggressive resizing) after hiding the message; JPEG payloads live in metadata blocks that many editors strip away.
- Strong passwords still matter: scrypt slows down brute-force attempts but weak passwords remain vulnerable.
- In terminal mode the script uses `getpass` so passwords are not echoed to the screen.

## Development Notes
Sample files `test_input.png` and `test_output.png` may exist if you run local tests. Remove them manually when they are no longer needed:

```bash
rm test_input.png test_output.png
```
